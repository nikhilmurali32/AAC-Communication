I eat peanut butter sandwiches by folding the bread in half—it’s easier that way.

I drink lemonade with it and feel the cold sting in my throat.

I feel tired when the room is too bright and noisy, like everything is too much.

I don’t like bright lights when I’m trying to sleep, so I always pull my hoodie over my head.

I get happy when people laugh with me, not at me—and I can tell the difference.

My stomach pain came back after lunch, so I just leaned forward and stayed quiet.

When Ed Sheeran’s slow songs come on, I close my eyes and rock gently. That’s how I feel the music inside.

When we saw the snow falling, I jumped and pointed to the window. I was happy, even before going outside.

Sometimes I play hide and seek with my cousin behind the couch and under the table.

In school today, we painted pictures of animals, and I chose to make a lion.

I watched the ceiling fan spin slowly and counted how many times it made a full turn.

The keys on the table were arranged in a perfect row, and I didn’t want anyone to move them.

I stared at the fish tank for a long time and tried to follow only the yellow one.

The elevator lights blinked one by one, and I liked guessing which floor would come next.

I folded the same piece of paper six times before I threw it away.

I listened to the clicking sound my pen made when I pressed it over and over again.

The hallway smelled like paint, and I held my breath every time I walked through it.

I kept opening and closing the window blinds just to see the stripes appear on the floor.

The clock on the wall ticked louder than usual, and I started tapping my shoe in sync.

I found a tiny screw on the floor and spent five minutes trying to figure out where it came from.
